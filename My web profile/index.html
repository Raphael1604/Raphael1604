	  <img src="images/Rugby.JPG" id="Rugby-smaller">

	  <p>I've been playing rugby since I was 5. I've been captain of my team for several years which allowed me to live unique experiences within my club and my team</p>	
	
      <h3>NBA</h3>

	  <p>I'm a huge fan of NBA basketball which is a very spectacular sport league. Lebron James, the best player of the world made me fall in love in love with this sport.</p>

	  <h3>Cinema </h3>

	  <p>My parents have passed on to me the passion for cinema since I was a child. I am always ready to go and see the last movie released in the cinema. </p>

	  <img src="images/Patagonie.jpg" id="patagonie-smaller"> 

	  <p>Last february, I started an exchange program at Buenos Aires wwith one of my friends. The first thing we did when arriving is to do a two weeks road trip in Patagonia. I have to say that it was the travel of a lifetime and that I've seen memorable things. I advise everyone to visit Tierra del Fuego and its memorable landscapes. </p>

      <h2>Favourite celebrity</h2>

	  <h3>Lebron James</h3>

	  <img src="images/LebronJames.jpg" id="LBJ-smaller">

	  <p>His work ethic and altruism made him my everyday example. He's an example of success and hardworking and my goal is to see him play before he retires. He's more than an athlete, he takes part in the social problems of his generation and uses his influence to try to solve them. Two years ago, he created I promise school, a free school for children in need in the poor neighborhoods of his hometown of Cleveland. </p>
